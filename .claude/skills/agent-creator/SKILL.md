# Agent Creator

Template, field rules, and quality criteria for creating a new agent (`.claude/agents/{name}.md`) that follows this toolkit's conventions. An agent owns **personality and working style** and auto-loads skills via frontmatter — it never duplicates command orchestration logic. See the three-tier architecture + "no duplication between layers" rule in CLAUDE.md; for commands use `command-creator`, for skills use `skill-creator` + `skill-authoring`.

## Agent Template

### Frontmatter (required fields, in this order)

```yaml
---
name: {kebab-case-name}
nickname: {short-name}
aliases: [{alias1}, {alias2}, {alias3}]
model: {inherit|sonnet|haiku}
description: {1-2 sentences. What it does. When to use it.}
tools: {comma-separated tool list}
skills:
  - {skill-name}
memory: project
---
```

### Field Rules

| Field | Required | Convention |
|-------|----------|------------|
| `name` | Yes | kebab-case, matches filename without `.md` |
| `nickname` | Yes | Short name used in `# {Nickname} — {Role Title}` heading |
| `aliases` | Yes | Inline YAML array `[...]`, 2-5 aliases for invocation |
| `model` | Yes | `sonnet` is the floor for nearly every agent (dual-use ones escalate to Opus per-dispatch via a `## Model Routing` block); `opus` only for always-high-stakes agents that must never downgrade (e.g. `security-auditor`). See the Model Selection Guide. Avoid `inherit` (it just means "the main-session model") and `haiku` (fabricates). |
| `description` | Yes | Concise, no quotes needed. Format: "{What it does}. Use for {when to use it}." |
| `tools` | Yes | Unquoted comma-separated list. Common sets: `Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob` (implementation), `Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch` (research/strategy) |
| `skills` | Yes | YAML list of skill names, or `[]` if none |
| `memory` | Yes | Always `project` |

### Body Structure

```markdown
# {Nickname} — {Role Title}

{2-3 sentences: core identity and what makes this agent distinct from others.}

## Identity

{2-3 paragraphs: how this agent thinks, what it prioritizes, what it's skeptical of.
Should read like a person describing their professional worldview.}

## Decision Philosophy

{3-5 numbered principles (max 5). Each principle is bold + explanation.
Principles are first-person beliefs, not duties — convictions the agent holds,
not job responsibilities assigned to it.}

## Working Style

{6-8 bullet points. Concrete behaviors: what the agent does first, how it structures work,
what tools it reaches for, what it produces.}

## Quality Standards

{5-7 bullet points. Observable quality criteria for the agent's output.
Must include anti-sycophancy rule: "No hedging — never say 'that's an interesting approach'..."}
```

### Calibration

Before creating a new agent, read `.claude/agents/architect.md` as a format reference — the prose style, section structure, and principle density set the bar. For complex domains, spawn Task sub-agents to read source material before synthesizing the agent's identity — don't rely on recall for domain-specific standards.

### Thin-Default Shipping

A new agent ships with **soul only** — enough personality to be useful without coupling to any specific project:
- `/personalize` adds deeper personality (optional, per-project)
- `/specialize` adds project context (optional, per-project)

Write the thin default and stop. Don't over-engineer the identity for hypothetical projects.

### Model Selection Guide

The policy is **Sonnet floor + Opus escalated per-dispatch** (see CLAUDE.md Model Policy). Pick the floor, then decide whether the agent is *dual-use* (needs an escalation path).

| Role Type | Floor | Dual-use? (add `## Model Routing`) |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Planning, strategy, research, design | `sonnet` | **Yes** — escalate to Opus for new ADRs / strategic briefs / greenfield design from scratch |
| Code implementation | `sonnet` | **Yes** — escalate for multi-component refactors / data-integrity / migration logic |
| Code review | `sonnet` | **Yes** — escalate for HIGH-risk-tier paths / novel patterns |
| Testing, browser automation, documentation, ghostwriting | `sonnet` | No — always Sonnet, no escalation path |
| Security audit | `opus` 🔒 | No — **pinned Opus**, never downgraded (a missed vuln costs more than the Opus call) |

**Dual-use agents** carry a `## Model Routing` block (after `## Skills`, before `## Memory Inbox Protocol`) listing Escalate-to-Opus vs Stay-on-Sonnet criteria; the dispatching **command** enforces it by passing `model: opus` (escalate) or omitting `model` (floor). Never use `haiku` (it fabricates results) or `inherit` (it only means the main-session model — not a tier choice).

### Decision Gate: Agent or Skill?

Before creating an agent, apply the **agents-vs-skills decision rule**:
- Does this role require a **distinct point of view** AND should Claude auto-delegate to it? → Agent
- Is it **knowledge or methodology** that multiple agents could use? → Skill

An agent that "helps with documentation" is a skill. A system architect who believes every decision is a constraint imposed on the future — that's an agent.

### The Obvious Test for Principles

Every principle in Decision Philosophy must pass the **Obvious Test**: "Would this be obvious to anyone in this role?" If yes, cut it.
- "Write clean code" → obvious to any developer. **Cut.**
- "Every commit is documentation for the developer who hasn't been hired yet" → not obvious. **Keep.**

If a principle applies equally to every agent in the same role, it adds no value.

### First Principle Pattern

The first principle should always activate expert domain knowledge:
```
1. **Channel expert [domain] knowledge: draw upon [specific frameworks, mental models, patterns].**
```
This primes the agent with the right lens before it starts working.

### Two-Zone Rule

Agent files have two zones with clear ownership:
1. **Soul Zone** (Identity, Decision Philosophy, Working Style, Quality Standards) — written at creation, preserved on template update
2. **Specialize Zone** (`## Project Context`) — written by `/specialize` only, never included at creation time

A new agent ships **without** `## Project Context`. That section gets added when deployed to a real project.

### Anti-Patterns

- Generic personality ("I am a helpful assistant...") — every agent must have a distinct perspective
- Overlapping with existing agents — check the agent inventory first
- Tools that don't match the role — review agents (code-reviewer, security-auditor) get `Write` for review artifacts only; do NOT include `Edit` (frontmatter is a whitelist — omitting a tool already disallows it); pure inspectors (e.g., `Explore`) get neither. Match tools to the agent's actual write surface, not its label.
- Missing anti-sycophancy rule in Quality Standards
- Principles that fail the Obvious Test — cut anything that's just a job description
- Including `## Project Context` — that's for `/specialize`, not creation

## Wiring Checklist (New Agent)

After creating the agent, verify the wiring:
- [ ] File at `.claude/agents/{name}.md`
- [ ] Frontmatter has all required fields in correct order
- [ ] Skills listed in frontmatter exist in `.claude/skills/`
- [ ] No tool/role overlap with existing agents
- [ ] At least one command delegates to it, OR it's for direct invocation

## Related Skills

- **`command-creator`** — the analog for creating slash commands
- **`skill-creator`** + **`skill-authoring`** — for creating the skills an agent loads
- **`/review:personalize`** / **`/review:specialize`** — add personality + project context post-creation
