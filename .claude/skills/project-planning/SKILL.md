# Project Planning

Consolidated methodology for the product planning pipeline — from problem space exploration through brainstorm/research, to project brief, to full product requirements document (PRD), to the epics/stories backlog, plus the project-context quick-reference. Consolidates `project-analyst`, `project-brief-writer`, `prd-writer`, `epic-writer`, and `project-context`.

The genuine design disciplines — technical architecture and UX design — stay as their own self-contained skills (see Navigation). This skill owns the planning-pipeline *text* documents.

## Planning Pipeline Position

```
brainstorm / research   →   references/brainstorm-research.md
       ↓
project brief           →   references/project-brief.md
       ↓
PRD / requirements      →   references/project-requirements.md
       ↓
epics / stories backlog →   references/backlog.md
       ↓
project context         →   references/project-context.md   (quick-ref for /prime; maintained across the lifecycle)

architecture / design   →   self-contained `architecture` / `ux-design` skills (see Navigation)
```

## Cross-Cutting Rules

These rules apply across every document in the pipeline:

1. **Interview before generating.** Never fabricate user requirements, personas, or constraints. Use AskUserQuestion to gather what you don't know before writing any section.

2. **Every FR needs Given/When/Then acceptance criteria.** A functional requirement without a testable AC is not a requirement — it is a wish. Format: `Given {precondition}, When {action}, Then {expected result}`.

3. **MoSCoW must be mixed.** The target distribution is approximately Must Have ~40%, Should Have ~30%, Could Have ~20%, Won't Have ~10%. If everything is "Must Have", the prioritization is wrong — push back and force trade-offs.

4. **Problem-space only — capture constraints, defer picks.** Planning docs (brief and PRD) describe *the user, the use case, goals, and constraints* — never *how to build it*. The architecture phase owns HOW (tools, libraries, hosts, services). The line is between a **constraint** and a **pick**:
   - A **constraint** *bounds* the solution space and comes from the user's reality — keep it: "no build step", "$0/month", "must work offline", "must decouple from the X platform", "vanilla JS only", locked business facts.
   - A **pick** *selects one option* when alternatives would satisfy the constraint — defer it to architecture: "use Web3Forms", "host on Netlify", "store leads in Redis", a proposed section flow.
   - If the user volunteers a pick, record it as a **stated preference for the architecture phase to weigh**, not as a locked decision. Don't recommend tools the user didn't ask for. A premature pick in a planning doc anchors every downstream agent into rubber-stamping or arguing against it, and collides with the architecture phase's own (correct) reasoning. Strip the pick and the architect reasons cleanly from the constraints — which is its job.

5. **Verify an asserted fact before you build a plan on it.** Before sizing a TODO/backlog around a claimed *system behavior* (a capability gap, a missing dependency, a limitation) or around a *research/synthesis doc's recommendation*, prove the claim against reality first — a 30-second probe, or a grep/read of the live code. Do not trust the assertion (or a stale research doc) on faith. A whole remediation backlog was once built on "FTS5 needs an npm install" — false; a one-line `node -e` probe disproved it. Verify *each* "we should fix X" against the actual files before it becomes scoped work; an unverified premise produces a plan that solves a problem that does not exist.
