/**
 * telemetry-log.js — self-instrumentation for user-typed slash commands.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * command-usage-logger.cjs only captures `command_invocation` telemetry when
 * Claude Code routes a command through the Skill tool (PostToolUse:Skill).
 * USER-TYPED slash commands (`/onboard`, `/run-todo`, `/do`, …) are expanded
 * directly into the user message in Claude Code 2.x — no PostToolUse:Skill
 * event fires, so they leave NO record in command-usage.jsonl. (This is the
 * documented coverage gap at the top of command-usage-logger.cjs.)
 *
 * The fix path named there is: "instrument the slash commands themselves to
 * write a telemetry entry from their preamble." This is that instrument. A
 * command markdown calls it once near the top of its workflow:
 *
 *     node .claude/core/telemetry-log.js onboard
 *
 * and the invocation shows up in command-usage.jsonl with source
 * 'self-instrumented' (so it's distinguishable from Skill-tool-captured rows).
 *
 * DURATION: a single preamble call cannot measure how long the command took
 * (it hasn't finished). duration_ms is therefore null for command_invocation
 * rows — gate_run rows carry real durations (stamped by gate.js). A command
 * that wants its own duration can pass it explicitly once it completes.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node .claude/core/telemetry-log.js <command-name> [duration_ms]
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 on success, 2 on bad usage. Never throws on write failure —
 * telemetry is best-effort observability, not a gate.
