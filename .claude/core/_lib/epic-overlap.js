/**
 * epic-overlap — Detect file ownership overlaps between epics in a _backlog.md.
 *
 * Wave-based execution in /run-todo dispatches parallel agents per wave. When two
 * epics claim the same file, concurrent agents produce silent merge conflicts.
 * This module makes that problem visible before /run-todo fires.
 *
 * Phase-awareness (F6): /run-todo dispatches waves PER PHASE — epics in
 * different `## Phase` sections never run concurrently, so a file shared across
 * phases cannot cause a wave collision. Only SAME-PHASE overlaps gate readiness;
 * cross-phase overlaps are reported as informational. This avoids forcing the
 * author to hand-acknowledge dozens of physically-impossible collisions.
 *
 * Exports:
 *   extractEpicFiles(backlogPath)        → Map<epicId, Set<filePath>>
 *   extractEpicPhases(backlogPath)       → Map<epicId, phaseLabel|null>
 *   findOverlaps(epicFilesMap, phaseMap?) → Array<{epicA, epicB, sharedFiles, samePhase?}>
 *       (samePhase is only present when a phaseMap is supplied)
 *
 * CLI:
 *   node epic-overlap.js <backlog-path>
 *   Exit 0 — no overlaps, OR only cross-phase (informational) overlaps
 *   Exit 1 — SAME-PHASE overlaps found (gating; report printed to stdout)
 *   Exit non-zero (via throw) — backlog file not readable
