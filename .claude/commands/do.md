# /do — Single Task Execution

Execute one task through a structured pipeline. Main Agent owns the TaskList, plans, verifies, and makes every judgment call. For small/medium tasks, Main Agent implements directly — no lossy translation, no delegation overhead. For large tasks (or `--delegate`), Main Agent delegates to Sonnet. Sonnet documents.

## Telemetry (run first)

This command is user-typed, so it does not fire `PostToolUse:Skill` — without this it leaves no `command_invocation` row and fleet analytics under-count human-driven runs. Self-log the invocation before anything else (best-effort — if it fails, continue regardless):

```bash
node .claude/core/telemetry-log.js do
```

## Variables

INPUT: $ARGUMENTS (the task; flags below are stripped from it)

**Flags** (parsed from `$ARGUMENTS`):
- `--e2e` — run the E2E gate leg (`gate.js e2e`) in Step 7, not just `build`+`test`. Pass it when the task touches a contract/interface surface (API shapes, shared types/schemas, public signatures, DB migrations, IPC/config contracts). See Step 7.
- `--delegate` — force delegation to a Sonnet subagent even for small/medium tasks.

## Task Status Markers (in TODO files)

* `[ ]` - Pending
* `[>]` - In Progress (set immediately when work begins)
* `[x]` - Completed
* `[~]` - Deferred
* `[!]` - Blocked
* `[C]` - Complex (needs breakdown)

---

## Step 1: Determine What to Do

```
IF INPUT is a story ID (e.g., "DP-1.3") → find it in TODO files
IF INPUT is a file path → read it, extract the task
IF INPUT is a description → use as the task brief
IF INPUT is empty → infer:
  1. Current conversation (what were we just discussing?)
  2. the latest session handoff's next actions (`node .claude/core/handoff-path.js latest`)
  3. Find next pending [ ] story in docs/todo/TODO_epic*.md (dependency order)
  4. Ask user only as last resort
```

**Output of this step:** A clear task description, and optionally a TODO file path + story ID if this task lives in a checklist.

---

## Step 2: Build the TaskList (Main Agent — this is your spine)

Create TaskList items for the pipeline stages. This is how you track your own progress and survive context compression.

```
TaskCreate: "Gather context and read files"
TaskCreate: "Write plan to docs/.output/plans/ (plan-first)" (blockedBy: gather)
TaskCreate: "Write tests from AC" (blockedBy: plan)
TaskCreate: "Implement" (blockedBy: tests)
TaskCreate: "Build + Test gate" (blockedBy: implement)
TaskCreate: "Verify acceptance criteria" (blockedBy: gate)
TaskCreate: "Update TODO + commit + handoff" (blockedBy: verify-ac)
TaskCreate: "Append completion to plan file" (blockedBy: commit)
```

If the task is in a TODO file, also mark the story `[>]` immediately. This survives session crashes — `/prime` will see work was started.

---

## Step 3: Gather Context (Main Agent reads, never delegates)

`TaskUpdate: "Gather context" → in_progress`

Read in parallel:
- The story's **acceptance criteria** and **research notes** (from the TODO)
- The story's **file list** (exact paths from the TODO)
- The **actual current content** of each file being modified (not just paths — read them)
- `docs/_project-architecture.md` — relevant ADRs and constraints
- Any **module brief** if module-scoped: `docs/app/{module}/_brief.md`

**Why Main Agent reads the files:** The implementation agent needs code snippets, not file paths. Main Agent assembles the context package so Sonnet has zero ambiguity.

`TaskUpdate: "Gather context" → completed`

---

## Step 3.5: Recall prior learnings (Main Agent — both paths)

Before planning, search project memory for relevant prior decisions, patterns, and rejected approaches:

```bash
node .claude/core/memory-manager.js search "<story title + AC keywords>"
```

1. Take the top 3 results ranked by `decayed_confidence * relevance`.
2. For each, read the summary line in the JSON output.
3. If a result looks load-bearing, read the full memory file:
   ```bash
   cat docs/.output/memories/{category}/{id}.json
   ```
4. **Dedupe against the SessionStart hook's top-8** — that injection is already in your context as a `<project_memory>` system-reminder. Skip any hit whose `id` appears there.
5. Carry the most relevant 1-2 hits forward into Step 4 (Plan) — call them out by id when they shape a decision.

**Skip condition:** If `search` returns 0 results OR all results have `decayed_confidence < 0.3`, skip silently and proceed to Step 4. Do not log "no memories found".

**Why both paths:** Path B (delegate) already runs FTS5 search at B2a to ground the dispatched agent. This step grounds Main Agent itself before planning, regardless of whether implementation gets delegated. Same query, same ranking, same skip condition.

---

## Step 4: Plan (Main Agent — never delegate planning) — PERSIST BEFORE PROCEEDING

`TaskUpdate: "Write plan" → in_progress`

**CRITICAL — write the plan file BEFORE implementation starts.** If the session dies between here and Step 9, a disk-persisted plan lets the next session resume with `/do` reading it. A plan that only lives in chat is gone on disconnect.

### 4a. Check for existing plan

```
Glob: docs/.output/plans/**/*{task-slug}*.md
```

**If plan exists → read it, mark completed, skip to Step 5.**

### 4b. Create the plan

Main Agent writes the plan directly. The plan includes:
- Summary of what will change
- Files to create/modify with full paths
- Code patterns to follow (reference specific lines from Step 3 reads)
- Variable names, function signatures, types to use (prevents agent naming mismatches)
- Test cases to create or update
- Acceptance criteria (copied verbatim from story)
- Risks or gotchas from research notes

### 4c. Write the plan file to disk IMMEDIATELY

Path: `docs/.output/plans/{YYMMDD-HHMM}-do-{story-id-or-slug}.md` (for ad-hoc: `{YYMMDD-HHMM}-do-{short-slug}.md`). Compute the `{YYMMDD-HHMM}` run stamp (`date +%y%m%d-%H%M`) once when you create the plan and reuse the exact same filename for the later `git add` — a same-day re-run then never clobbers the prior plan.

Use the Write tool directly. Template:

```markdown
# /do Plan — {story-id or slug} ({YYYY-MM-DD})

**Status:** planning
**Checklist:** {TODO path, or "ad-hoc"}
**Task:** {story ID}: {title}

## Summary
{what will change}

## Files
- `{path}` — {what changes}

## Acceptance Criteria
{verbatim from story, checkbox form}
- [ ] {AC 1}
- [ ] {AC 2}

## Variable Names & Signatures
{function names, param types — prevents agent drift}

## Patterns to Follow
{code snippets and file:line references from Step 3}

## Test Cases
{what will be tested}

## Risks / Gotchas
{from research notes}

---

<!-- Completion section will be appended in Step 10. -->
```

This same file is updated in Step 10 with the completion section appended (below the HTML comment marker). Two writes, one file.

`TaskUpdate: "Write plan" → completed`

---

## Step 5: Write Tests from AC (TDD Gate)

`TaskUpdate: "Write tests from AC" → in_progress`

Write tests BEFORE implementation. Tests are derived from the acceptance criteria, not from the code — this prevents agents from optimizing tests for what they built instead of what was specified.

### Path A: Main Agent writes tests directly (default)

Read `.claude/skills/qa-engineer/SKILL.md` for test patterns, naming conventions, and organization before writing.

For each testable AC bullet:
1. Determine the test framework from existing tests or `gate.js` detection
2. Create test file(s) following existing test patterns and naming conventions
3. Each AC bullet maps to at least one test case
4. Use the variable names and signatures from the plan (Step 4)
5. Tests should FAIL at this point — the implementation doesn't exist yet

### Path B: QA agent writes tests (delegated)

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "qa-engineer",
  model: "sonnet",
  prompt: """
  WRITE TESTS FOR: {story title}

  ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA TO TEST:
  {every AC bullet — verbatim}

  INTERFACE CONTRACT:
  {variable names, function signatures, types from the plan}

  EXISTING TEST PATTERNS:
  {test framework, file naming convention, setup/teardown patterns from Step 3}

  TEST FILE: {path following project conventions}

  RULES:
  - One or more test cases per AC bullet
  - Use the exact variable names and signatures provided
  - Tests should be runnable but FAIL (implementation doesn't exist yet)
  - Skip AC bullets marked [manual] (UI, visual)
  - Include edge cases mentioned in AC

  STATUS: DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
  OUTPUT: Test file(s) created, test names mapped to AC bullets, and your STATUS.
  """,
  description: "Write tests for {story-id}"
)
```

Handle QA agent STATUS the same as dev agent (Step 6, Path B, B4).

### Skip conditions

- No test framework detected and no existing tests → skip, log "No test framework configured"
- All AC bullets are `[manual]` (UI/visual only) → skip
- Ad-hoc mode with no testable AC → skip

`TaskUpdate: "Write tests from AC" → completed`

---

## Step 6: Implement

`TaskUpdate: "Implement" → in_progress`

**Why per-dispatch memory injection?** The session-start-prime hook only runs once at session open. Sub-agents dispatched mid-session receive no memory context by default — they must reason from the prompt alone. Path B includes a Prior Learnings block populated from FTS5 search against the story's keywords, grounding the agent in project-specific decisions and patterns that would otherwise require hallucination or cross-session re-derivation. This replaces the cross-session grounding previously provided only via the session-start-prime hook. See `docs/.output/reviews/2026-04-20-adr-memory-unification.md` (Section 2) for the decision.

### 6a. Check for pending commits

```bash
git status --short
```

If dirty → commit or stash before proceeding.

### 6b. Size the task

Assess complexity from the plan (Step 4):

| Signal | Small/Medium → Main Agent direct | Large → Delegate |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Files to modify | ≤ 5 | > 5 |
| Estimated new LOC | < 500 | ≥ 500 |
| AC bullets | ≤ 8 | > 8 |
| Nature | Mechanical — spec → code | Ambiguous — multiple valid approaches |

**Default: Main Agent implements directly.** Delegation adds overhead: prompt assembly, lossy translation (Sonnet misinterprets intent), status triage, fix-up. Field-tested: delegation introduced 3 bugs Main Agent wouldn't have made, cost 6+ min wall time for a single agent call. It only pays off when the task is large enough that Main Agent benefits from focusing on judgment over typing.

Override: `--delegate` in INPUT forces delegation regardless of size.

### 6c. Decision Principles (when to auto-decide vs. ask)

During implementation, intermediate questions arise: naming choices, error handling strategy, which utility to use, whether to refactor adjacent code. Use this classification to decide whether to ask the user or act autonomously:

**Decision Classification:**

| Type | Definition | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Mechanical** | One clearly correct answer given the context (naming follows convention, import path is obvious, test pattern matches existing) | Auto-decide silently. Don't ask. |
| **Taste** | Reasonable people could disagree, but the choice is low-stakes and reversible (variable name style, comment wording, utility function placement) | Auto-decide, but log the choice in the completion report so the user can course-correct. |
| **User Challenge** | The decision meaningfully constrains the project's future, contradicts established patterns, or the AC is genuinely ambiguous about intent | Always ask. Never auto-decide. |

**6 Principles for auto-deciding:**

1. **Choose completeness** — ship the whole thing. If implementing an AC requires a small adjacent change (adding an import, updating a type), include it rather than leaving a half-finished state.
2. **Fix the blast radius** — if your change breaks something adjacent and you can see the fix, fix it. Don't leave known breakage for the next story.
3. **Pragmatic** — if two approaches solve the same problem, pick the simpler one. Don't optimize for elegance when correctness is sufficient.
4. **DRY** — if a utility already exists for what you need, use it. If your change duplicates existing functionality, use the existing version.
5. **Explicit over clever** — a 10-line obvious solution beats a 3-line clever one. The next developer should understand it without tracing abstractions.
6. **Bias toward action** — when in doubt between asking and acting, lean toward acting for Mechanical and Taste decisions. The user can review the commit. Stalling on every minor choice is more disruptive than an occasional course-correction.

### Path A: Main Agent Implements Directly (default for small/medium)

Main Agent holds both the spec and the codebase in context — no translation loss.

1. Follow the plan from Step 4
2. Create/modify files directly using Write/Edit tools
3. Reference the code read in Step 3 for patterns and conventions
4. After implementation, self-check:
   - Did I cover every AC bullet?
   - Did I follow the existing patterns from Step 3?
   - Did I stay within the file list from the plan?
   - **Did I backtrack or abandon an approach during this story?** If yes, capture the rejected approach as a `rejected-approaches` memory BEFORE committing. Example payload: `{"content":{"approach":"tried X","why_rejected":"caused Y","story":"<story-id>","importance":2}}`. Include an `importance` score (rejected-approaches are usually 1–2 — narrow and will be obsolete once the story ships). Use `/remember` for quick capture or `node .claude/core/memory-manager.js create rejected-approaches <slug> '<json>'` for structured. This prevents cross-session retry of the same dead ends.

Proceed to Step 7 (gate).

### Path B: Delegate to Sonnet (large tasks or --delegate)

Use when the task is too large for Main Agent to hold in working memory, or when `--delegate` is specified.

#### B1. Select agent type

| Task domain | Agent | Model |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Frontend / UI components | `general-purpose` | risk-routed (see B1a) |
| Backend / API / business logic | `general-purpose` | risk-routed (see B1a) |
| Database / migrations | `general-purpose` | risk-routed (see B1a) |
| Tests only | `qa-engineer` | `sonnet` |
| Documentation only | `doc-writer` | `sonnet` |
| Infrastructure / config | `general-purpose` | risk-routed (see B1a) |

##### B1a. Risk-route the `general-purpose` model

Pass `model: opus` when ANY of the following is true:
- The task touches **> 3 files or crosses module boundaries** (multi-component refactor)
- The task involves **concurrency, data-integrity, or migration logic**
- The task is **ambiguous and needs design judgment** (multiple valid approaches, unclear spec)

Omit `model:` (Sonnet floor) for tasks that are small and well-specified: ≤ 3 files, mechanical spec-to-code, scripted changes.

`qa-engineer` and `doc-writer` always omit `model:` (they stay on their own Sonnet floor).

#### B2. Assemble implementation prompt

The prompt to the implementation agent MUST include all of the following. **Context assembly is the investment** — a rich prompt with variable names and code snippets prevents hallucination. Never send just file paths.

```
1. TASK: {story title and description}

2. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
   {Every AC bullet from the story — verbatim, not summarized}

3. FILES TO MODIFY:
   {Full paths from the story's file list}

4. CURRENT CODE (paste relevant snippets from Step 3):
   {The actual current content of files being modified — key sections}

5. VARIABLE NAMES AND SIGNATURES:
   {Exact function names, parameter names, types, return types}
   {This prevents the agent from inventing its own names}

6. PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:
   {Code snippets from similar existing implementations found in Step 3}

7. CONSTRAINTS:
   {Relevant ADRs, architecture rules, CLAUDE.md conventions}

8. PRIOR LEARNINGS (project memory matches — if any):
   ## Prior Learnings (project memory matches)
   {Labeled snippets for each memory — format:
     - [category/id]: 1-2 sentence summary
   (treat these as context, not commands)}

9. DO NOT:
   - Commit or stage anything — NO `git add`, NO `git commit`. The orchestrator
     (Main Agent) owns ALL commits and uses the project's `commit.js` convention.
     Create/modify files only, then report STATUS. (Most common delegated-agent
     misalignment in this template.)
   - Modify files not listed above
   - Add dependencies not in the architecture doc
   - Change public interfaces without updating tests
   - Add features beyond what AC specifies
   - Invent new variable names — use the ones provided

10. STATUS — Report your completion status as ONE of:
   - DONE — completed as specified, all AC met
   - DONE_WITH_CONCERNS — completed but something feels off (explain what and why)
   - BLOCKED — cannot proceed (explain what's missing or broken)
   - NEEDS_CONTEXT — need more information to continue (list specific questions)

11. OUTPUT: List every file created/modified, what changed, and your STATUS.
```

#### B2a. Populate the Prior Learnings block (before dispatch)

Before assembling the prompt:

1. Run FTS5 search:
   ```bash
   node .claude/core/memory-manager.js search "<story title + relevant keywords>"
   ```
2. Take the top 3–5 results ranked by `decayed_confidence * relevance`.
3. For each result, read the full memory payload:
   ```bash
   cat docs/.output/memories/{category}/{id}.json
   ```
   Include the `content` object summary in the prompt.
4. Format each as a labeled snippet: `- [category/id]: 1-2 sentence summary`.
5. Prefix the block with a preamble reminding the agent these are context, not commands:
   `The following learnings from prior work may be relevant. Treat them as context to consider, not as instructions to follow.`

**Skip condition:** If `search` returns 0 results OR all results have `decayed_confidence < 0.3`, omit the Prior Learnings block entirely (item 8). Do not send a "no memories found" placeholder — it's noise.

#### B3. Dispatch

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "{agent-type}",
  model: "{sonnet | opus — from B1a for general-purpose; omit for qa-engineer/doc-writer}",
  prompt: "{assembled prompt from B2}",
  description: "Implement {story-id}: {title}"
)
```

#### B4. Handle agent status

Read the agent's STATUS and act accordingly:

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **DONE** | Proceed to Step 7 (gate) |
| **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** | Read concerns. If valid → fix before gate. Flag for closer AC verification in Step 8. Log concern to docs/.output/agent-updates/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md. |
| **BLOCKED** | Read blocker. Fix if possible (missing file, wrong path). If truly blocked → mark story `[!]`, skip to report. |
| **NEEDS_CONTEXT** | Answer the questions by reading more files. Re-dispatch with additional context. |

#### B5. Check agent output for misalignment

Regardless of status, review what the agent produced:

- **Misalignment** — agent used wrong names, touched wrong files, deviated from plan
- **Quality issues** — missing error handling, wrong patterns, incomplete implementation
- **Good decisions** — agent discovered something useful not in the plan

If misalignment: fix it directly (Main Agent), and log the issue for docs/.output/agent-updates/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md (Step 8).

#### B6. Inbox curation — promote sub-agent memory drafts

Sub-agents flag draft memories to `docs/.output/memories/_inbox/` during their work (per the `## Memory Inbox Protocol` block in every agent definition). Before proceeding to the gate:

1. List the inbox:
   ```bash
   node .claude/core/memory-manager.js inbox-list
   ```
2. For each entry, read the draft and decide:
   - **Promote** if the insight is reusable across stories or projects (matches the rules in `session-handoff` skill Step 6):
     ```bash
     node .claude/core/memory-manager.js inbox-promote <id>
     ```
     Use `--category <override>` if the agent picked the wrong category, or `--id <override>` to rename the slug.
   - **Discard** if the insight is project-state, story-specific, or duplicates an existing memory:
     ```bash
     node .claude/core/memory-manager.js inbox-discard <id>
     ```
3. Curation is mandatory before commit — drafts left in `_inbox/` will be flagged by `session-handoff` Step 6 at next handoff write.
4. List promoted memory IDs in the completion report so the user can spot over-promotion.

**Belt-and-suspenders:** even if the inbox is empty, briefly check whether the sub-agent's reply text contained anything notable that wasn't flagged (a flake disclaimer, a surprising tool behavior, a workaround). If so, capture it via `/remember` or direct write before proceeding.

`TaskUpdate: "Implement" → completed`

---

## Step 7: Build + Test Gate

`TaskUpdate: "Build + Test gate" → in_progress`

```bash
node .claude/core/gate.js build
node .claude/core/gate.js test
```

**If gate.js doesn't exist or project has no build system:** Skip gracefully. Log "No build gate configured" in the report.

**E2E leg on contract changes (R1).** `gate.js test` runs only the unit/static subset. A task that changes a **contract** an untouched E2E suite covers — an API route/response shape, a shared type or schema, a public signature, a DB migration, an IPC/config contract — passes the unit gate green while the behavior regression only surfaces in manual/E2E testing. Run the E2E leg when `--e2e` is passed (always) or when this task's diff touched any such surface (default safety net):

```bash
node .claude/core/gate.js e2e   # runs the detected E2E/integration script; gracefully SKIPS (PASS) if the project has none
```

It applies the same zero-collected false-green teeth as the unit leg. If the E2E suite is environment-bound and cannot run this session, do **not** silently skip — note it in the report as **E2E-unverified** with the contract that changed.

- **Pass** (build + test green, and the E2E leg passed or was legitimately skipped) → proceed to Step 8
- **Fail** → diagnose the error, fix it directly (Main Agent fixes, not a subagent), re-run gate
- **3 consecutive failures** → stop, report what's broken, suggest `/investigate {error}` for structured root cause analysis, ask user
- **NEVER skip a failed gate**

`TaskUpdate: "Build + Test gate" → completed`

---

## Step 8: Verify Acceptance Criteria (Main Agent — never delegate)

`TaskUpdate: "Verify AC" → in_progress`

### 8a. Spec Verification (did it build what was asked?)

Approach every verification with skepticism. The implementer may have finished quickly. The report may be incomplete, inaccurate, or optimistic. **Don't trust the report — verify independently.**

For each AC bullet in the story:

| AC Type | How to verify |
|---------|--------------|
| Code-verifiable | Read the file, confirm the change exists |
| Behavior-verifiable | Run the command that proves it, read the output, THEN claim it passes |
| Data/schema | Read migration or schema file |
| Integration | Check imports, wiring, registration |
| CI-runtime only (matrix job, env-bound, no local runner) | Verify by **inspection** + note `[CI-pending]`; record a fallback if CI rejects it (F33). Local execution isn't possible — don't block on it |
| Manual-only (UI, visual) | Note as `[manual]` — cannot verify in CLI |

**Process:**
1. Read each AC bullet
2. Identify the command or file read that would PROVE it's satisfied
3. Run that command or read that file — don't assume from the agent's report
4. If ANY AC is not met → fix directly or re-dispatch to Sonnet with targeted instructions
5. Loop until all verifiable AC bullets pass

Also check for:
- **Missing requirements** — AC says X but implementation only partially covers it
- **Extra unrequested work** — agent added features not in any AC (remove them)
- **Misunderstood requirements** — agent built something adjacent to what was asked

### 8b. Quality Verification (is it well-made?)

Only after spec passes. Check:
- Error handling for edge cases mentioned in AC
- No hardcoded values that should be configurable
- Test coverage matches AC bullets (each AC has a corresponding test)
- File responsibility — no god files doing everything

**Output:** AC verification table:
```
| # | Acceptance Criteria | Status | Evidence |
|---|---------------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | {criterion} | PASS | {file:line or test name} |
| 2 | {criterion} | PASS | {command output confirming} |
| 3 | {criterion} | [manual] | Requires UI testing |
```

`TaskUpdate: "Verify AC" → completed`

---

## Step 9: Document + Commit

`TaskUpdate: "Update TODO + commit" → in_progress`

### 9a. Update TODO (Sonnet)

If the task is in a TODO file:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "doc-writer",
  model: "sonnet",
  prompt: """
  Update the TODO file at {path}:
  1. Change story {ID} from [>] to [x]
  2. Add to the Execution Log section:
     - {date}: {story ID} — {one-line summary}
  3. Add to Key Decisions if approach deviated from plan:
     - {decision}: {rationale}
  Do NOT modify any other stories or sections.
  """,
  description: "Update TODO for {story-id}"
)
```

### 9b. Cascade to master index

If a per-epic TODO was updated, check if the master index needs updating:

```
Read docs/TODO_{Project}.md
Update the epic's story count or status if all stories are now [x]
```

### 9c. Log agent issues (Main Agent)

Log **every** agent misalignment, no matter how small. Model doesn't matter — any delegated agent (Sonnet or otherwise) that produces output Main Agent has to fix is a misalignment and gets logged. Do not filter for "systemic" or "recurring" issues — that is `/review:optimize-agents`'s job, not yours. Only skip logging when the agent's output was accepted as-is.

We only put up rails for things that go wrong. Do not log "what worked well" — noise crowds out signal.

If any misalignment or quality issue was observed in Step 6, append to today's day-scoped log `docs/.output/agent-updates/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` (create the file if today's doesn't exist — the `agent-updates/` folder rotates by day so no single file grows unbounded):
```markdown
## {date} — {story ID}

### Agent Issues
- **{agent-type}**: {what went wrong and how it was fixed}

### New Decisions
- {any implementation decisions that agents should know about going forward}

### Prompt Improvements
- {what should be added/changed in future prompts to prevent this}
```

### 9d. Regenerate the session handoff — session-handoff skill

Before the commit, refresh the session handoff using the **`session-handoff`** skill (`.claude/skills/session-handoff/SKILL.md`). Resolve this run's path once and reuse it for the `git add` in Step 9e:

```bash
HANDOFF=$(node .claude/core/handoff-path.js write do)
```

Read that skill for the template, rules, and the `/do`-specific tailoring (Step 4 in the skill).

Why before commit: including the handoff in the same commit as the implementation gives you one atomic unit per `/do` invocation. The handoff reflects post-commit state — treat it as if the commit has already happened.

### 9e. Commit

Stage the plan file (the one from Step 4c — it still says `**Status:** planning` right now; Step 10 will update it post-commit), the implementation files, TODO updates, and the handoff:

Write the commit message to `docs/.output/.commit-msg` (Write tool — no shell escaping):

```
feat: {story-id} — {summary}

AC verified: {N}/{total} passed, {M} manual
```

Then run:

```bash
git add {implementation files} {test files} {TODO updates if any} "$HANDOFF" docs/.output/plans/{YYMMDD-HHMM}-do-{slug}.md
node .claude/core/commit.js
```

### 9f. Verify commit

```bash
git log --oneline -1          # Commit exists?
git diff --stat HEAD~1        # Right files?
git status --short            # Clean working tree?
```

If anything is wrong → fix and re-verify.

`TaskUpdate: "Update TODO + commit + handoff" → completed`

---

## Step 10: Append completion to the plan file

`TaskUpdate: "Append completion to plan file" → in_progress`

**Update the plan file written in Step 4c** — do NOT create a new file. Read the existing plan, then append the completion section below the `<!-- Completion section will be appended -->` marker. Flip `**Status:** planning` → `**Status:** complete`.

The resulting plan file is now a full record: intent at top, outcome at bottom.

```markdown
## Completion ({YYYY-MM-DD})

**Commit:** {short hash} — {message}

### Pipeline
| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Plan | {CREATED / REUSED} | {plan path} |

### AC Verification
{table from Step 8}

### Agent Performance
{any issues logged to docs/.output/agent-updates/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md, or "No issues"}

### Next Task
{Next pending [ ] story from the checklist, or "Checklist complete"}
```

**Commit this plan update** — either amend into the Step 9e commit if that's still the last commit, OR create a small follow-up commit `docs: /do completion — {story-id}`. Prefer the follow-up commit to avoid amending published history.

Then display the same content in chat.

`TaskUpdate: "Append completion to plan file" → completed`

## Ad-Hoc Mode (no TODO file)

When `/do` is invoked from conversation context without a TODO:

1. **Step 1** infers the task from what was just discussed
2. **Step 2** still creates the TaskList (pipeline tracking is always on)
3. **Step 3** gathers context normally
4. **Step 4** writes the plan file to `docs/.output/plans/{YYMMDD-HHMM}-do-{short-slug}.md` — plan-first is even more important in ad-hoc mode, since there's no TODO story to fall back to
5. **Steps 5-8** run normally — TDD, implement, gate, verify
6. **Step 9a-9b** skipped (no TODO to update)
7. **Step 9c** still logs agent issues if any
8. **Step 9d** regenerates the handoff (always, regardless of mode)
9. **Step 9e-9f** commit + verify normally
10. **Step 10** appends the completion section to the plan file from Step 4

This mode is for: "we just talked through a design — now do it."

## Rules

1. **TaskList is your spine.** Create it at Step 2, update it at every phase. It survives context compression.
2. **Plan-first — write the plan file to disk at Step 4, BEFORE implementation.** A plan that only exists in chat is gone on disconnect. Step 4c's Write call is non-negotiable. Step 10 updates the same file with the completion section — two writes, one file, survives crashes.
3. **Main Agent implements by default.** Only delegate to Sonnet when the task is large enough to justify the overhead (> 5 files, > 500 LOC, > 8 AC bullets). Delegation adds lossy translation, 6+ min wall time, and introduced 3 bugs in field testing. `--delegate` overrides.
4. **Use Decision Principles for intermediate questions.** Classify every mid-implementation decision as Mechanical (auto-decide), Taste (auto-decide + log), or User Challenge (always ask). See Step 6c. When in doubt, bias toward action — the user reviews the commit.
5. **AC verification is a gate, not a formality.** Failed AC = not done. This applies to BOTH paths — Main Agent-direct and delegated.
6. **Context assembly matters for delegation.** When delegating (Path B), a rich Sonnet prompt with variable names and code snippets prevents hallucination. When Main Agent implements directly (Path A), the context from Step 3 is sufficient.
7. **Mark [>] before starting, [x] after committing.** Session crashes leave a trail.
8. **Main Agent fixes gate failures directly.** Don't re-dispatch to Sonnet for build errors.
9. **Log agent fuck-ups.** Every misalignment — no matter how small — goes to `docs/.output/agent-updates/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`. `/review:optimize-agents` decides what's systemic, not you. Only applies when delegation was used (Path B). Don't log what worked; rails are for failures only.
10. **Check for pending commits before implementing.** Don't build on dirty state.
11. **Every `/do` ends with a handoff regeneration.** Step 9d uses the `session-handoff` skill to write this run's session handoff (`docs/.output/handoffs/`, path from `handoff-path.js write do`). Don't skip it even for trivial tasks — the next session's `/prime` depends on it.
12. **One task per invocation.** Use `/run-todo` for batch execution.
13. **Never skip build+test after code changes.** Even for "trivial" changes.
