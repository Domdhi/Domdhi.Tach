# Evolve Skills

The autonomous driver for self-improving skills. It reads the failure/learning signals the toolkit already collects, turns them into **skill work** — a brand-new skill (CREATE) or a fix to an existing one (IMPROVE) — validates each candidate with the `skill-creator` skill's **differential eval harness**, and applies it on your confirmation.

This is the *autonomous* layer over two other parts of the system:
- **`skill-creator`** (the skill) — the manual Create/Eval/Improve/Benchmark loop + the Node eval harness. This command drives it.
- **`skill-authoring`** (the skill) — the doctrine: a skill is justified by **evidence of a real gap first, then a differential eval after** (the rule that replaced "failing test first"). This command operationalizes that.

## Telemetry (run first)

This command is user-typed, so it does not fire `PostToolUse:Skill` — without this it leaves no `command_invocation` row and fleet analytics under-count human-driven runs. Self-log the invocation before anything else (best-effort — if it fails, continue regardless):

```bash
node .claude/core/telemetry-log.js review:evolve-skills
```

## The two signals (and why each is legitimate evidence)

| Path | Signal source | Why it's a real baseline |
|------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **IMPROVE** | `docs/.output/agent-updates/*.md` misalignments + recurring gate failures, attributed to the skill that owns that domain | The misalignment IS the "current behavior failed" baseline — the `old_skill` already lost in the field |
| **CREATE** | Clusters of recurring `workflows` + `patterns` memories that **no existing skill covers** | The recurrence across N memories is the evidence agents keep re-deriving this unaided — the Voyager/Hermes "write the reusable pattern down" move |

CREATE is deliberately distinct from `/review:promote-memories` (which injects a *single* validated memory into an *existing* skill/CLAUDE.md). This command synthesizes a *new* skill from a *cluster*, or rewrites a skill from *failure traces*.

## Variables

- `--improve-only` / `--create-only` — run just one path (default: both).
- `--auto` — **sweep mode**: propose-only. Run intake + draft candidates + **the differential eval that gates them** (against a **workspace copy** — the live skill in `.claude/skills/` is never touched), but do NOT apply, commit, or iterate. Surface staged proposals for human review. Used by `/sweep` Phase 5b. (Skill *bodies* are the system's brain — never mutate them unattended; there is no safe auto-threshold for a rewrite, unlike memory promotion.) The differential always runs — it is the falsifier — `--auto` only withholds *applying* the result. "Propose-only" ≠ "skip the eval"; a proposal with no Δ is not a proposal.
- `--apply <skill-name>` — apply a previously-staged proposal for that skill: **runs the differential eval (the real gate)**, then re-validates conformance + the build/test gate, then commits. A non-positive `summary.delta.pass_rate` **blocks** the apply (see *What NOT to Do*) — conformance + build passing is necessary but not sufficient.
- `--since YYYY-MM-DD` — only consider agent-updates on/after this date (default: all day-rotated files).

## Orchestration Rule

> You (the main agent / Opus) own the reflective diagnosis and the SKILL.md authoring — that is the "why did it fail / what should the skill say" judgment. Dispatch `general-purpose` subagents **on Sonnet** (pass `model: sonnet` on every such dispatch) only for the eval *runs* (with_skill / baseline) and grading — that work is mechanical execution (run the suite, grade against the rubric), not judgment, so it stays on the cheaper tier while Opus keeps the diagnosis + authoring. (`general-purpose` is a Sonnet-tier agent by frontmatter; the explicit `model: sonnet` makes the rule load-bearing so a future caller can't silently escalate the eval fleet to Opus.) Follow the **`skill-creator`** skill for the loop mechanics and the **`skill-authoring`** skill for the doctrine; read them, don't paste them here.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Intake (deterministic)

```bash
node .claude/core/skill-evolution.js intake --since <date-or-omit> --date <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

This writes `docs/.output/skill-evolution/{date}/intake.{json,md}` with ranked **IMPROVE** candidates (per-skill, with the agent-update evidence + per-signal `polarity`), **CREATE** candidates (memory clusters with member IDs + keywords), and a **`dispatchGaps`** list. Read `intake.json`. If `improve` and `create` are both empty → report "no skill-evolution signal" and stop.

> **`dispatchGaps` are NOT skill-evolution candidates.** Each is a signal that attributed to a review/safeguard skill but whose text shows the safeguard *caught* the defect — so the gap is in the **dev-agent dispatch prompt** (e.g. `/run-todo`'s implementation prompt), not in the review skill. Do **not** open a skill eval for these (it would read Δ=0, exactly the wasted cycle two projects reported). Surface them in the Report under "Dispatch-prompt gaps" for the human to route; the scorer attributes by domain keyword and cannot tell *caught* from *slipped*, so it pre-separates them here. Likewise, an IMPROVE evidence line tagged `(caught)` is weaker evidence (a safeguard fired) than one tagged `(slipped)` — weight the diagnosis accordingly.

### Step 2 — Triage with the user (skip under `--auto`)

Present the candidates compactly:
- **IMPROVE** `<skill>` — N misalignments; one-line each.
- **CREATE** `<proposed-name>` — N memories clustered; the keywords + member memory descriptions.

Ask which to pursue (Accept / Skip per candidate). Under `--auto`, pursue every candidate that clears the bar (IMPROVE: ≥1 attributed misalignment; CREATE: cluster size ≥3 OR avg confidence ≥0.8) and stage proposals without applying.

### Step 3 — Reflective diagnosis (Opus)

For each pursued candidate, read the evidence and the relevant skill, then diagnose the *gap*:
- **IMPROVE** — read the named skill's `SKILL.md` + each cited agent-update section. What did the skill say (or fail to say) that let the misalignment happen? Is it missing a rule, ambiguous, or contradicted by reality? Confirm the evidence is a genuine empirical RED (an agent actually failed) — if it's speculative, drop it. No "this could be clearer" edits without a failure behind them.
- **CREATE** — read each member memory (`docs/.output/memories/{cat}/{id}.json`). What single reusable capability do they share? Is it broad enough to be a skill (not project-specific — that belongs in CLAUDE.md per `skill-authoring`)?

### Step 4 — Draft / edit (follow `skill-creator`)

- **IMPROVE** → snapshot the skill (`cp -r .claude/skills/<skill> <workspace>/skill-snapshot/`), then make the surgical edit. The snapshot is the `old_skill` baseline.
- **CREATE** → scaffold `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (name==dir; pushy what+when description; explain-the-why body; progressive disclosure). The baseline is `without_skill`.

Write the workspace + test cases per `skill-creator` Step "Running and evaluating test cases":
`docs/.output/skill-evolution/{date}/<skill>-workspace/`.

### Step 5 — Differential eval (the proof the gap closed)

Follow `skill-creator` Steps 1–4: dispatch with_skill + baseline runs in the same turn, capture `timing.json`, grade via `agents/grader.md` into `grading.json`, then aggregate:

```bash
node .claude/core/skill-eval.js aggregate <workspace>/iteration-1 --skill-name <name> --date <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

**Replicates & fixtures (esp. IMPROVE):** run **≥2 replicates per config** (`with_skill/run-1/`, `run-2/`, … and the same for the baseline) — a single sample per cell is too noisy to justify a skill-body rewrite. Include **at least one fixture where the targeted gap is the *only* thing that discriminates**, and do **not** telegraph the planted defect (no `# raises KeyError here` comments next to the bug): a fixture that signposts the issue saturates detection in *both* configs, so the delta collapses to framing and measures nothing.

**Expected layout** (the aggregator globs exactly this — wrong names load 0 records):
```
<workspace>/iteration-1/
  eval-<id>-<name>/
    eval_metadata.json
    with_skill/    grading.json (+ timing.json)   |  with_skill/run-<k>/grading.json …
    without_skill/ | old_skill/   (same shape — the baseline)
```

Read `benchmark.json`. **Check `benchmark.warnings` first** (and watch for a non-zero exit / `WARN:` lines): a present-but-malformed `grading.json` or a dropped baseline makes the harness exit **3** and flag the eval — the delta is then built on incomplete data and is **not** trustworthy until you fix the named file and re-aggregate. The candidate is only legitimate if **`summary.delta.pass_rate > 0`** with **no warnings** (with_skill beats baseline). A zero/negative delta means the edit didn't help — iterate or drop it; do NOT apply a skill change that the differential doesn't justify. Run the analyst pass (`agents/analyzer.md`) and generate the viewer (`eval-viewer/generate-review.js --static`) for the human.

### Step 6 — Gate + apply

For each candidate that cleared the differential (and that the user accepts — under `--auto`, **stage only, do not apply**):

1. Conformance gate the final body:
   ```bash
   node .claude/core/skill-evolution.js check <skill-name> .claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
   ```
   Must PASS (name==dir, description ≤1024, body ≤500 WARN). Fix any ERROR before applying.
2. Run the build/test gate (a new/edited skill must not break the suite):
   ```bash
   node .claude/core/gate.js test
   ```
   If it fails → stop, report, leave unapplied.
3. The change is already on disk (Step 4 wrote it). Record the proposal + benchmark delta in `docs/.output/skill-evolution/{date}/proposals.md`.

### Step 7 — Commit

Stage the skill file(s) + the workspace artifacts + `proposals.md`. Write the message to `docs/.output/.commit-msg` (Write tool, no `Co-Authored-By`), then `node .claude/core/commit.js`:

```
feat: /review:evolve-skills — {CREATE <name> | IMPROVE <skill>} (pass-rate Δ +N pts)

{one line per applied candidate with its benchmark delta}
```

Under `--auto`, do NOT commit applied skill changes (nothing was applied) — the sweep's report carries the staged proposals.

## What NOT to Do

- Do NOT run the eval/grading subagents on Opus — they are mechanical (execute the suite, grade against the rubric), so they MUST be dispatched as `general-purpose` with `model: sonnet`. Opus stays on the main-agent diagnosis + `SKILL.md` authoring only.
- Do NOT apply a skill change whose differential `delta.pass_rate` is not positive — the eval is the whole point.
- Do NOT propose an edit without empirical evidence of a gap (an agent-update misalignment, a gate failure, or a recurring memory cluster) — speculative polish is out of scope (`skill-authoring` doctrine).
- Do NOT auto-apply skill-body changes under `--auto` — stage proposals; the human confirms.
- Do NOT duplicate `/review:promote-memories` — that injects one memory into an existing skill; this synthesizes a new skill from a cluster or rewrites from failure traces.
- Do NOT push to remote.
