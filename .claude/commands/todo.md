# /todo — Create Execution-Ready TODO

Create a TODO checklist that `/run-todo` can execute without additional research. Every story has acceptance criteria, file lists, estimates, and research notes. Dependencies are optimized, waves are pre-computed.

Main Agent does all planning and assembly. Research agents (Sonnet) scan the codebase. The output is a contract — `/run-todo` trusts it completely.

## Telemetry (run first)

This command is user-typed, so it does not fire `PostToolUse:Skill` — without this it leaves no `command_invocation` row and fleet analytics under-count human-driven runs. Self-log the invocation before anything else (best-effort — if it fails, continue regardless):

```bash
node .claude/core/telemetry-log.js todo
```

## Variables

INPUT: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Phase 1: Context Gathering (Main Agent — direct reads, no agents)

### 1. Determine Input Type

```
IF INPUT is a file path → read it as source material
IF INPUT is an epic number → read Epic N from docs/todo/_backlog.md, use its stories as the brief
IF INPUT is a module name → find docs/app/{name}/_brief.md, read it
IF INPUT is a task description → use as the brief
IF INPUT is empty → infer from (first that yields a concrete target wins):
  1. Current conversation context
  2. Master index docs/TODO_{Project}.md → the next epic (see "Next-epic resolution" below)
  3. the latest session handoff's next actions (`node .claude/core/handoff-path.js latest`)
  4. Recent git log (what was just completed → what's next)
  5. Ask user only as last resort
```

**Next-epic resolution (empty INPUT — the lifecycle "what now?" loop).** When INPUT is empty and the conversation gives no specific target, consult the master index before falling back to the handoff/git heuristics. This is the source of truth no command previously read for "what's next," and it's what makes the post-`/evolve` loop self-continue (the lead epic is made ready by `/evolve` Step 5.6; *subsequent* epics get picked up here):
1. Find the master index — `docs/TODO_{Project}.md` (the single `TODO_*.md` at the `docs/` root, not the per-epic files under `docs/todo/`). If absent or an unfilled `<!-- @@template -->` stub, skip to inference source #3.
2. Parse its epic rows and pick the **next** epic: prefer an **in-progress** epic (🔄 / partially-checked) if one exists — resume it — otherwise the **first not-done** epic (⬜ / `[ ]` todo, in index order). Skip ✅/`[x]` done epics. If every epic is done, say so (the cycle is complete → suggest `/evolve`) and stop.
3. Resolve that epic to its **epic number** and hand off to the **epic-number branch** above (read Epic N's stories from `_backlog.md`). Announce the resolution in the report so it's never silent: `No INPUT given — resolved next epic from master index: Epic {N} — {title}.`
This is deterministic and respects the same `_backlog.md` source the epic-number branch uses; the handoff/git fallbacks (#3/#4) remain for repos without a master index.

**Epic-number branch (check before treating INPUT as a task description).** INPUT is an epic number when the **entire trimmed INPUT is exactly one integer token** (`12` — but NOT `12 factor app setup`, a multi-token input that merely *starts* with a number, which is a task description), or it matches an `epic N` / `epic-N` / `epicNN` / `EX-NN` style epic identifier (case-insensitive). When it is:
1. Read `docs/todo/_backlog.md` and locate that epic's section (its heading + story list). If `_backlog.md` is missing or is still an unfilled `<!-- @@template -->` stub, fall back to treating INPUT as a literal task description and note it.
2. If the epic isn't found in `_backlog.md`, say so and list the epic numbers that *do* exist — do not silently treat the number as a task description.
3. Use that epic's title + objective + stories as the brief. The epic's stories become the seed stories for the TODO (research still resolves exact file paths per story in Phase 2 — the backlog gives titles/AC intent, not file lists).
4. This mirrors `/create:project-epics-todo`'s epic-aware resolution; `/todo {epic}` is the single-epic, execution-ready unit that `/evolve` Step 5.6 calls for the lead epic.

### 2. Gather Project Context

Read in parallel:
- `docs/_project-architecture.md` — architecture boundaries, schemas, ADRs
- Module docs: `docs/app/{module}/_brief.md` (if module-scoped)

---

## Phase 2: Research (Sonnet agents — scaled to complexity)

**CRITICAL: All research agents MUST persist their output to files.** Agent results evaporate when context compresses — persisted files are the permanent record.

**Reuse warm session agents before cold-spawning.** If agents earlier in THIS session already hold relevant context — e.g. an audit or investigation that motivated this TODO and already read the target files — RESUME them with a focused deep-dive prompt (SendMessage to the `agentId`) instead of cold-spawning fresh researchers. A warm agent skips rediscovery, already knows the file layout, and returns exact signatures faster. Still require it to persist findings to the research file below. Cold-spawn only for subsystems no prior agent has touched.

**Resolve scope-forking unknowns IN research, before sizing.** When a story's file count hinges on a yes/no the research can answer (e.g. "does this abstraction already exist, or does this need a new file?"), make the research agent answer it explicitly. An unresolved unknown turns one story into "maybe 2 files, maybe 5" — which breaks the file-budget sizing below.

### Recall prior learnings (Main Agent — before sizing or dispatch)

Search project memory before estimating story count or dispatching research agents. ACs don't exist yet at `/todo` time, so query on INPUT plus module/feature keywords from Phase 1:

```bash
node .claude/core/memory-manager.js search "<INPUT topic + module keywords>"
```

1. Take the top 3 results ranked by `decayed_confidence * relevance`.
2. Read summary lines from JSON output. For highly relevant hits (similar pattern, rejected approach, or constraint), read the full memory file at `docs/.output/memories/{category}/{id}.json`.
3. **Dedupe against the SessionStart hook's top-8** — skip any hit whose `id` is already in the `<project_memory>` system-reminder.
4. Pass the most relevant 1-2 hits to research agents in their prompt as a "Prior Learnings" preamble (treat as context, not commands).
5. Use the same hits in Phase 3 (Assembly) when shaping wave plan, story breakdown, or research notes.

**Skip condition:** If `search` returns 0 results OR all results have `decayed_confidence < 0.3`, proceed silently to story sizing.

### Per-Agent File Budget (HARD CAP — this drives story slicing)

Every story maps to exactly **one** dev agent at `/run-todo` time. Size each story so that agent's scope is small enough it **physically cannot fill its context window and compact mid-implementation.** A compacting agent silently drops AC items and fabricates "done" — this is the single most common cause of a TODO that builds green but ships incomplete.

**Hard cap per story / per dev agent:**
- **≤ 5 files MODIFIED**
- **≤ 2 files CREATED**
- (test files count toward these limits)

If a unit of work exceeds the cap, **SPLIT it** into parallel sub-stories partitioned by orthogonal concern (e.g. service slice / component slice / wiring slice / test slice). **Strongly prefer more, smaller stories and more parallel agents over fewer fat ones** — narrow agents finish faster, never compact, and parallelize. There is no penalty for a 12-story TODO of tiny stories; there is a real penalty for a 4-story TODO of 10-file stories (a fat-scope agent that compacted mid-task dropped an acceptance criterion with a fabricated "deferred" comment).

Every story MUST carry an **Agent budget** line (files modified / files created) so the cap is auditable before dispatch. The self-review (Phase 3b) fails the plan if any story exceeds it.

### Estimate Story Count First

Slice to the file budget FIRST (above), THEN count the resulting stories. This determines how many *research* agents scan the codebase. Bias toward the higher row when borderline — granular is the goal:

| TODO Size | Stories | Research Agents | Review |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|--------|
| **Small** | 1-4 | 0 (Main Agent reads inline) | None |
| **Medium** | 5-7 | 1 Sonnet (Codebase + Deps) | Optional |
| **Large** | 8+ | 2 Sonnet (parallel) | 1 Sonnet |

### Research Output Location

```
docs/.output/work/YYYY-MM-DD/{slug}/
  HHMM-research-codebase.md    ← Agent 1 (medium + large)
  HHMM-research-patterns.md    ← Agent 2 (large only)
```

### Agent 1: Codebase + Dependencies (Medium and Large)

**Use `general-purpose` (NOT `Explore`) — Explore is read-only and cannot write its findings to disk, which means output evaporates on context compaction.**

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "sonnet",
  prompt: """
  Research the codebase for: {INPUT}

  ## Codebase Scan
  1. Find all files that will need modification — exact paths
  2. Find existing implementations to use as patterns
  3. Find test files for affected components
  4. Check for guard tests that may break

  ## Dependency Analysis
  5. Map every file each proposed change would touch
  6. Identify overlaps — which files appear in multiple changes?
  7. Build dependency graph — which changes must complete before others?
  8. **Hotspot detection:** identify any file that would be touched by 3+ stories. If ALL stories share a single hotspot file, flag the TODO as single-hotspot — Main Agent will apply the collapse shape in Phase 3.
  9. Compute candidate wave groupings under both shapes: (a) file-overlap partitioning (zero overlap per wave) and (b) functional grouping for single-hotspot collapse. Leave the final shape decision to Main Agent.
  10. **Shared-git-index check:** if a wave's stories each run `git mv` / `git rm` / `git add` on the SAME working tree, they contend on `.git/index.lock` even when their files are disjoint — disjoint files ≠ disjoint git state. Flag such a wave `git-serial`: it must execute Main-Agent-direct sequentially, NOT as parallel agents, regardless of file-overlap partitioning. (Field-proven: skill-owned-templates Wave 2, six disjoint `git mv` migrations — ran sequential to avoid index-lock races.)

  Write findings to: docs/.output/work/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{slug}/{HHMM}-research-codebase.md
  """,
  description: "Research codebase for {slug}"
)
```

### Agent 2: Pattern + Convention Scanner (Large only — 8+ stories)

**Use `general-purpose` (NOT `Explore`) — same reason as Agent 1.**

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "sonnet",
  prompt: """
  Research patterns and conventions for: {INPUT}

  1. How are similar features implemented in this codebase?
  2. What shared components, services, or utilities exist?
  3. What naming conventions, file organization patterns apply?
  4. What test patterns are used (framework, structure, naming)?

  Write findings to: docs/.output/work/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{slug}/{HHMM}-research-patterns.md
  """,
  description: "Research patterns for {slug}"
)
```

---

## Phase 3: Assembly (Main Agent — direct authorship, not delegated)

Main Agent writes the TODO directly. Do NOT delegate assembly to a subagent — Main Agent has the full context from Phase 1 + Phase 2 research files.

### Template (ENFORCED — all sections required)

```markdown
# TODO: {Title}

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Status** | Specification Complete |
| **Author** | {user} |
| **Created** | {YYYY-MM-DD} |

---

## Executive Summary

{2-3 sentences: what this TODO accomplishes and why}

---

## Dependency Graph

{ASCII art showing story dependencies and wave groupings}

---

## Phase N: {Phase Name}

**Goal:** {One sentence}

---

### Epic {PREFIX}-N: {Epic Name}

**Objective:** {One sentence}

---

* **Story {PREFIX}-N.N ({Size}): {Story Title}**
  * **As a** {role}, **I want** {action}, **So that** {benefit}.
  * **AC:**
    * [ ] {Specific, testable acceptance criterion}
    * [ ] {Another specific criterion}
  * **Estimate:** {XS|S|M|L}
  * **Dependencies:** {None | Story X.X}
  * **Files:**
    * `{exact/path/to/file}` — {what changes}
  * **Agent budget:** {N} modified, {M} created — within ≤5/≤2 cap
  * **Research notes:** {What currently exists, what's missing, gotchas}

---

## Story Index

| Story | Title | Size | Wave | Status | Dependencies |
|-------|-------|------|------|--------|--------------|
| {PREFIX}-N.N | {title} | {XS/S/M/L} | {wave #} | [ ] | {deps} |

**Total: N stories. Estimated: ~N hours.**

---

## Wave Plan

**Shape:** {role-based | single-hotspot collapsed | file-overlap partitioned} — {one-sentence justification. If single-hotspot collapsed, also include: "Collapsed N original stories into M bundled stories by functional grouping."}

### Wave 1 — {Tests | functional bundle name | independent stories}
| Story | Agent Type | Files Owned | Budget (mod/new) | Needs QA? |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| {ID} | general-purpose | {files} | {n}/{m} | Yes/No |

### Wave 2 — {Code | next bundle | next independent group} (depends on Wave 1)
| Story | Agent Type | Files Owned | Budget (mod/new) | Needs QA? |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| {ID} | general-purpose | {files} | {n}/{m} | Yes/No |

### Wave 3 — {Verify | final bundle | ...} (depends on Wave 2)
| Story | Agent Type | Files Owned | Budget (mod/new) | Needs QA? |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| {ID} | general-purpose | {files} | {n}/{m} | Yes/No |

### Shared Hotspot Files
- **{file}** — touched by stories {X, Y}. In file-overlap shape: must be in different waves. In single-hotspot shape: expected (this is the hotspot that drove collapse).

### Critical Path & Parallel Workstreams (REQUIRED)
- **Critical path:** {Story → Story → Story} — the longest dependency chain; ~{hours}. This is the floor on wall-clock no matter how many agents you add.
- **Parallel workstreams:** {N} independent chains that run concurrently — {chain A} ∥ {chain B} ∥ {chain C}. Each chain owns a disjoint file set.
- **Max concurrent agents:** {N} (the widest wave).
- **Bottleneck:** {Story ID} — {why; e.g. it adds the interface every Wave-2 story consumes}. If it slips, everything downstream slips.

---

## Key Findings from Research

1. **{Finding}** — {detail with file paths}
2. **{Finding}** — {detail}
```

### Template Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **Every story has AC bullets with checkboxes** — specific, testable, used as gates by `/do` and `/run-todo`
2. **Every story has a Files section** — exact paths from codebase research, not guesses
3. **Every story has Research notes** — what exists now, patterns to follow, gotchas
4. **Every story has an Estimate** — XS (< 30 min), S (30-60 min), M (1-2 hr), L (2-4 hr)
5. **Story Index with wave column** — `/run-todo` reads this to know execution order
6. **Wave Plan with file ownership, QA flag, and Shape line** — `/run-todo` reads this directly. Shape line is required (see Wave Shape Decision below).
7. **File overlap constraint depends on the Shape** — in `file-overlap partitioned` shape, zero overlap per wave is mandatory. In `single-hotspot collapsed` shape, the hotspot file appears across waves *by design*. In `role-based` shape, overlap is allowed at the role-wave level but stories within a role-wave have zero overlap when dispatched in parallel.
8. **Dependency Graph** — ASCII art showing what blocks what
9. **No code blocks** — file paths and descriptions only. Implementation is the dev agent's job
10. **AC bullets are NEVER stripped or summarized** — they flow verbatim into `/do` and `/run-todo`
11. **Every story carries an Agent budget line within the HARD CAP** — ≤5 files modified / ≤2 files created (tests count). Split anything larger into parallel sub-stories. Bias toward more, smaller stories + more agents.

---

### Wave Shape Decision (Main Agent — apply before writing the Wave Plan)

Wave shape is not always file-overlap partitioning. Choose the shape that minimizes ceremony for the TODO's story composition, then fill in file ownership as a constraint within each wave.

Evaluate in this order and pick the first that fits:

**Shape A — Single-hotspot collapsed (check first).** Triggers when ALL stories would touch the same hotspot file AND no story is > M AND dependencies are strictly linear (story N depends on N−1). Collapse adjacent small stories into bundled M-size stories until there are at most 3 waves, ordered by **functional grouping** (e.g., "Layout + card shell" / "Form chrome" / "Footer + E2E coverage"), not by arbitrary story count.

  - Target: 2–3 bundled stories, 2–3 waves.
  - **Required warning line in the Executive Summary:** `Wave shape: single-hotspot collapsed — collapsed {N_original} stories into {M_bundled} bundled stories by functional grouping. File-overlap partitioning would have produced {N_original} forced-serial waves.`
  - Why: under pure file-overlap partitioning, one-hotspot TODOs force `waves = stories`. That pays full per-wave machinery (commits, handoff regen, gate runs, review cycles) for zero parallelism benefit. Field-measured cost on a 6-story single-hotspot TODO: ~30 min total, ~15 min pure ceremony, ~80k context on orchestration, and no offsetting speedup.
  - **Budget still applies:** each bundled story must respect the ≤5/≤2 file cap. If a functional bundle would exceed it, keep it split even though that forces an extra serial wave — correctness (no compaction) beats ceremony savings.

**Shape B — Role-based (Tests / Code / Verify) — the default for heterogeneous TODOs.** When stories span multiple files and conceptual areas and none of them qualifies for Shape A, organize as three role-scoped waves:
  - **Wave 1 — Tests:** one story per eventual feature that authors failing tests from AC. These stories have no file-overlap with each other (one test file per feature) and dispatch in parallel.
  - **Wave 2 — Code:** implementation stories that make the Wave 1 tests pass. Zero file-overlap within the wave; parallel dispatch.
  - **Wave 3 — Verify:** AC verification, E2E coverage, code review, and final commit.

  This replaces the old "file-overlap is the only partitioning rule" default. `/run-todo`'s per-wave TDD rhythm (Step 2b) still applies *within* each role-wave, but redundancy is minimized because Wave 1 is explicitly and solely about tests.

**Shape C — File-overlap partitioned (fallback).** Use when neither A nor B fits — deeply interdependent stories spanning many files where role-splitting creates artificial couplings, or where story-level AC is so heterogeneous that bundling under roles would lose reviewability. Historical default; remains available.

**Always declare the chosen shape in the Wave Plan heading** so `/run-todo` and human reviewers can see the intent:
- `## Wave Plan` + `**Shape:** single-hotspot collapsed — ...`
- `## Wave Plan` + `**Shape:** role-based (Tests / Code / Verify) — ...`
- `## Wave Plan` + `**Shape:** file-overlap partitioned — ...`

If the research agent flagged single-hotspot in Phase 2 and you chose a different shape anyway, the Executive Summary must include a one-sentence rationale (e.g., "Single-hotspot detected but not collapsed because two stories are M and exceed the collapse threshold").

---

## Phase 3b: Self-Review — No Placeholders (Main Agent — always run)

Before handing off to external review, Main Agent scans its own output for plan failures. If ANY of these are found, fix them before proceeding.

**Automatic failure conditions (fix immediately):**
- [ ] Any story contains "TBD", "TODO", "to be determined", or "placeholder"
- [ ] Any story says "similar to Story X" without specifying exact differences
- [ ] Any AC bullet says "properly", "correctly", "as needed", or "appropriate" without measurable criteria
- [ ] Any AC bullet says "add error handling" without specifying which errors
- [ ] Any story is missing the Files section or has only guessed paths (not from research)
- [ ] Any story is missing Research notes
- [ ] Any story is missing an Estimate
- [ ] Any story references an undefined story ID in Dependencies
- [ ] Wave Plan is missing the **Shape** line (role-based | single-hotspot collapsed | file-overlap partitioned) — required for every TODO
- [ ] In `file-overlap partitioned` shape: any wave has file overlap between stories (must be zero)
- [ ] In `single-hotspot collapsed` shape: Executive Summary is missing the required warning line (collapsed N → M stories) OR any bundled story is larger than M
- [ ] Research Agent 1 flagged single-hotspot but Main Agent chose a different shape without a one-sentence rationale in the Executive Summary
- [ ] Story Index is missing stories that appear in the body
- [ ] Any story exceeds the HARD CAP (> 5 files modified or > 2 files created) — split it into parallel sub-stories
- [ ] Any story is missing its **Agent budget** line
- [ ] Wave Plan is missing the **Critical Path & Parallel Workstreams** block

**This is a 30-second scan that catches 3-5 issues every time.** Do not skip it.

---

## Phase 4: Review (Sonnet — Large TODOs only, 8+ stories)

Skip for Small (1-4). Use judgment for Medium (5-7).

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "code-reviewer",
  prompt: """
  Review the TODO at {path} for execution readiness.

  ## Coverage
  1. Every AC is specific and testable (no "properly", "correctly", "as needed")
  2. File lists are complete — no story references files outside its list
  3. Missing error/empty/loading states in ACs

  ## Structure
  4. Wave groupings have zero file overlap (check file ownership)
  5. Dependencies are correct — no story depends on something in a later wave
  6. ACs don't contradict each other across stories

  Write findings to: docs/.output/work/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{slug}/{HHMM}-review.md
  DO NOT edit the TODO file.
  """,
  description: "Review TODO for {slug}"
)
```

---

## Phase 5: Synthesis (Main Agent)

Read the review findings. Decide what to accept. Apply accepted findings to the TODO file directly.

Main Agent is the single author of the TODO — review agents advise, Main Agent decides.

---

## Phase 6: Report

```markdown
## /todo Complete

**TODO:** {path} ({N} stories, ~{N} estimated hours)
**Research:** `docs/.output/work/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{slug}/` ({N} files)

### Story Breakdown
| Wave | Stories | Sizes | Est. Hours |
|------|---------|-------|------------|
| 1 | {IDs} | {sizes} | {hours} |
| 2 | {IDs} | {sizes} | {hours} |

### Ready for execution:
  /run-todo {path}
  /do {first-story-id}
```

---

## Phase 7: Regenerate the session handoff — session-handoff skill

After the report, refresh the session handoff using the **`session-handoff`** skill (`.claude/skills/session-handoff/SKILL.md`). Resolve this run's path once and reuse it for the `git add` in Phase 8:

```bash
HANDOFF=$(node .claude/core/handoff-path.js write todo)
```

Read that skill for the template, rules, and `/todo`-specific tailoring (Step 4 in the skill).

**Why:** a newly-created TODO is "ready to execute." The handoff's Next Actions should point at `/run-todo {path}` as #1 so the next session's `/prime` immediately surfaces what to do next. The TODO path + research files go in Key Files.

---

## Phase 8: Commit

Write the commit message to `docs/.output/.commit-msg` (Write tool — no shell escaping):

```
docs: /todo — create TODO for {slug} ({N} stories)
```

Then run:

```bash
git add {TODO_PATH} docs/.output/work/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{slug}/ "$HANDOFF"
node .claude/core/commit.js
```

---

## Rules

1. **Main Agent assembles the TODO directly** — do not delegate assembly to a planner agent. Main Agent has the full context.
2. **Research agents scan, Main Agent synthesizes** — agents find files and patterns, Main Agent makes decisions about story breakdown and wave grouping.
3. **ACs are sacred** — never strip, simplify, or summarize acceptance criteria. They are the contract.
4. **File lists come from code, not guessing** — research agents scan the actual codebase for paths.
5. **Wave plan is pre-computed** — `/run-todo` should not have to figure out parallelism.
6. **The TODO is a contract** — `/run-todo` and `/do` trust it completely. If it's wrong, they fail.
7. **No code blocks in stories** — file paths and descriptions only. Implementation is the dev agent's job.
8. **Always regenerate the session handoff (Phase 7) and commit (Phase 8).** A newly-created TODO that isn't surfaced in the handoff won't be picked up by the next session's `/prime`. Use the `session-handoff` skill (path via `handoff-path.js write todo`).
9. **Per-agent file budget is a HARD CAP** — ≤5 files modified / ≤2 files created per dev agent. More small stories + more parallel agents beats fewer fat ones. No background agent should ever compact mid-implementation.
10. **Reuse warm session agents when they already hold the context** — resume via SendMessage over cold-spawn; still persist findings to the research file.
